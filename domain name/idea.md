i'm creating a website, for english speaking people to learn arabic. The website will be called either Arabic Nur.

There will be interactive lessons and games for people to learn arabic in a fun and methodological approach

Lessons will be formatted this way: units > chapters > lessons, sort of like what they do in mango languages app. Each unit will be based on the grade the user is learning. So for example, unit 1-3 will be preschool arabic vocabulary, and numbers

unit 4-6 would be grade 1 arabic books, here users will learn vocab, grammar, and read actual childrens' books for grade 1 arabic students. 

and slowly as they progress on with more chapters and units, they will move on to a higher grade vocabulary and grammar books etc, and they will read arabic books that are meant to be for a higher level of arabic students.

I want this application to be fun and enjoyable, i also want the domain name and style of the application to be bright and uplifting, like duolingo. Here, people will come to enjoy and learn arabic anywhere, anytime on the go, with efficiency, ease and fun! Think through of the slogan, motto and goal of this website as well. 

Finally share what you think is the best for the vision i have for this website. The logo that i came up with is the arabic word for nur, in a nice arabic caligraphy. 

Maybe we can take things slowly, maybe give me some feedback for what you think of the idea, how i can improve the idea, as well as maybe the layout of the website? the header, hero, main menu. etc, then we can move on from there.
